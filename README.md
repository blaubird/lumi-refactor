# Project Refactoring Summary

## Overview of Changes

Based on the analysis of the repository and the recommendations provided, I've implemented a comprehensive refactoring of the project structure and codebase. The refactoring addresses the key issues identified in the analysis document and deployment error logs.

## Key Improvements

1. **Reorganized Project Structure**
   - Created a modular directory structure with clear separation of concerns
   - Organized code into logical modules (core, models, API endpoints, etc.)
   - Improved maintainability and readability

2. **Standardized Models**
   - Moved from a single models.py file to individual model files
   - Standardized on SQLAlchemy 2.x syntax exclusively
   - Created a proper Base class for all models to inherit from

3. **Fixed Alembic Configuration**
   - Updated env.py to properly handle environment variables
   - Created a single initial migration with the complete schema
   - Eliminated the risk of enum type duplication errors

4. **Improved Webhook Handler**
   - Simplified the webhook handler implementation
   - Added proper verification for Meta webhooks
   - Moved webhook logic to a dedicated endpoint module

5. **Added Setup Scripts**
   - Created setup_db.py for database initialization
   - Created create_tenant.py for test tenant creation
   - Eliminated the need for multiple fix scripts

## Files Created/Modified

### Core Configuration
- app/core/base.py - Base configuration
- app/core/config.py - Centralized configuration
- app/core/database.py - Database connection setup
- app/core/logging.py - Logging configuration

### Models
- app/models/base.py - Base model class
- app/models/tenant.py - Tenant model
- app/models/message.py - Message model
- app/models/faq.py - FAQ model with vector support
- app/models/__init__.py - Model exports

### API
- app/api/deps.py - API dependencies
- app/api/endpoints/webhook.py - Webhook handler

### Scripts
- scripts/setup_db.py - Database setup script
- scripts/create_tenant.py - Test tenant creation script

### Alembic
- alembic/env.py - Updated Alembic environment
- alembic/versions/001_initial_schema.py - Unified initial migration
- alembic.ini - Updated Alembic configuration

### Application Entry Point
- main.py - Simplified main application file

## Deployment Instructions

1. Copy the refactored project structure to your repository
2. Set the required environment variables (DATABASE_URL, WH_TOKEN, etc.)
3. Run the setup script: `python scripts/setup_db.py`
4. Start the application: `hypercorn main:app --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT`

## Next Steps

1. Complete the implementation of the remaining endpoints (admin.py, rag.py)
2. Add comprehensive tests for the refactored codebase
3. Update CI/CD pipeline to include migration checks
4. Consider adding more robust error handling and monitoring
